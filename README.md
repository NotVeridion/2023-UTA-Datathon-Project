# 2023-UTA-Datathon-Project by Matthew Nguyen, Vincent Trinh, and Tor Qureshi

This project was created in the 24-hour timespan of the 2023 UTA Datathon competition. My team worked to create a meaningful data visualization of a given dataset of Twitter tweets. The dataset solely consisted of tweet id's and tweet messages. The user is able to type in a word to search and a bar graph showing the relevance of that word throughout the years will appear.

## FILES INCLUDED: 
  - Python source file for running the interactive webUI for the user
  - .xlsx dataset of "Health Related" tweets given by the school for the Data Visualization Challenge 
  ##### (Make sure to have this file alongside the python code because it reads from the dataset directly)

  
Note: This project landed my team second place for the Data Visualization Challenge.
