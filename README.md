# 2023-UTA-Datathon-Project by Matthew Nguyen, Vincent Trinh, and Tor Qureshi

This project was created in the 24-hour timespan of the 2023 UTA Datathon competition. My team worked to make a data visualization of a dataset of Twitter tweets. The dataset solely consisted of tweet id's and tweet messages. The user is able to type in a word to search and a bar graph showing the relevance of that word throughout the years will appear.
